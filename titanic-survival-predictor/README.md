# Titanic Survival Predictor

This project predicts whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.  
Itâ€™s built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface.

## Project Overview
The model is trained using the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) containing passenger information such as:
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- Siblings/Spouses Aboard
- Parents/Children Aboard
- Fare
- Port of Embarkation (C, Q, S)

The trained model (`titanic_model.pkl`) predicts survival chances and provides reasoning for the prediction.
